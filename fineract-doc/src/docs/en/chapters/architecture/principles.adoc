= Principles

== RESTful API

The platform exposes all its functionality via a *practically-RESTful API*, that communicates using JSON.

We use the term *practically-RESTful* in order to make it clear we are not trying to be fully REST compliant but still maintain important RESTful attributes like:

* Stateless: platform maintains no conversational or session-based state. The result of this is ability to scale horizontally with ease.
* Resource-oriented: API is focussed around set of resources using HTTP vocabulary and conventions e.g GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HTTP status codes. This results in a simple and consistent API for clients.

See online API Documentation for more detail.

== Multi-tenanted

The Fineract platform has been developed with support for multi-tenancy at the core of its design. This means that it is just as easy to use the platform for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) type offerings as it is for local installations.

The platform uses an approach that isolates an FIs data per database/schema (See Separate Databases and Shared Database, Separate Schemas).

== Extensible

Whilst each tenant will have a set of core tables, the platform tables can be extended in different ways for each tenant through the use of Data tables functionality.

== Command Query Seperation

We seperate *commands* (that change data) from *queries* (that read data).

Why? There are numerous reasons for choosing this approach which at present is not an attempt at full blown CQRS. The main advantages at present are:

* State changing commands are persisted providing an audit of all state changes.
* Used to support a general approach to *maker-checker*.
* State changing commands use the Object-Oriented paradign (and hence ORM) whilst querys can stay in the data paradigm.

== Maker-Checker

Also known as *four-eyes principal*. Enables apps to support a maker-checker style workflow process. Commands that pass validation will be persisted. Maker-checker can be enabled/disabled at fine-grained level for any state changing API.
Fine grained access control

A fine grained permission is associated with each API. Administrators have fine grained control over what roles or users have access to.

== Package Structure

The intention is for platform code to be packaged in a vertical slice way (as opposed to layers).
Source code starts from https://github.com/apache/fineract/tree/develop/fineract-provider/src/main/java/org/apache/fineract

* accounting
* useradministration
* infrastructure
* portfolio
** charge
** client
** fund
** loanaccount
* accounting

Within each vertical slice is some common packaging structure:

* api - XXXApiResource.java - REST api implementation files
* handler - XXXCommandHandler.java - specific handlers invoked
* service - contains read + write services for functional area
* domain - OO concepts for the functional area
* data - Data concepts for the area
* serialization - ability to convert from/to API JSON for functional area
