= Step 2: Clean Up JIRA

== Description

Before a release is done, make sure that any issues that are fixed have their fix version setup correctly.

[source,text]
----
project = FINERACT and resolution = fixed and fixVersion is empty
----

Move all unresolved JIRA issues which have this release as Fix Version to the next release
[source,text,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
project = FINERACT and fixVersion = {revnumber} and status not in ( Resolved, Done, Accepted, Closed )
----

You can also run the following query to make sure that the issues fixed for the to-be-released version look accurate:
[source,text,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
project = FINERACT and fixVersion = {revnumber}
----

Finally, check out the output of the JIRA release note tool to see which tickets are included in the release, in order to do a sanity check.

== Gradle Task

.Command
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
% ./gradlew fineractReleaseStep2 -Pfineract.release.version={revnumber}
----
