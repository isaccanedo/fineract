= Step 12: Upload Distribution Release

== Description

In order to release you have to checkout release repository located on https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/fineract and add release artifacts there.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
% svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/fineract fineract-release
% mkdir fineract-release/{revnumber}/
% cp fineract-dist-dev/{revnumber}/* fineract-release/{revnumber}/
% svn add fineract-release/{revnumber}/
% svn commit -m "Fineract Release {revnumber}" fineract-release/{revnumber}/
----

You will now get an automated email from the Apache Reporter Service (no-reply@reporter.apache.org), subject "Please add your release data for 'fineract'" to add the release data (version and date) to the database on https://reporter.apache.org/addrelease.html?fineract (requires PMC membership).
