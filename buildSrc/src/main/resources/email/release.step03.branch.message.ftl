Hello everyone,

... as previously announced, I've just created the release branch for our upcoming ${project['fineract.release.version']} release.

You can continue working and merging PRs to the develop branch for future releases, as always.

The DRAFT release notes are on https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/${project['fineract.release.version']}+-+Apache+Fineract.  Does anyone see anything missing?

Does anyone have any last minutes changes they would like to see cherry-picked to branch ${project['fineract.release.version']}, or are we good go and actually cut the release based on this branch as it is?

I'll initiate the final stage of actually creating the release on ${project['fineract.release.date']} if nobody objects.

Cheers,

${project['fineract.config.name']}
